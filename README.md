JavaScript Stopwatch Main is a repository that provides a simple and customizable stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch application allows users to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch, as well as display the elapsed time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

The repository includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide the foundation for the stopwatch application. The HTML files include the basic structure for the stopwatch and user interface, while the CSS files provide the styling and layout of the stopwatch buttons and display. The JavaScript files contain the logic and algorithms for starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as updating the stopwatch display.

Users can customize the stopwatch by modifying the JavaScript code or adding new features. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels.
